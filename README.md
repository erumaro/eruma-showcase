Previous repos with similar code bases:
Early 2017: Eruma Go theme (now eruma-react-wp)

https://github.com/erumaro/eruma-react-wp

Semantic UI and CSS Flex based design designed to display content from WP Rest API.

Late 2017-Summer 2018: Eruma Portfolio

https://github.com/erumaro/eruma-portfolio

Redesigned version, without Semantic UI of Eruma go as a wp plugin with borrowed design from Eruma-Yon theme.
Local version have been tested and worked and looked nice, Live version release not working due errors. Need to fix these issues, but might take a while...

## 2019-2020 Rework
A planned rework of the code using updated React, Redux etc. code.
Will utilize current code as base, but modernize it.
The reworked version will also get a design / UI rework and follow in the Eruma Roku themes footsteps.
