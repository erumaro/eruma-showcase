# eruma-showcase
Portfolio built with React Redux. A child project built with old repo code as base.
This is the third iteration of my two previous versions. Currently being worked on design wise.

Displaying content from eruma.se.

Previous repos with similar code bases:
Early 2017: Eruma Go theme (now eruma-react-wp)
https://github.com/erumaro/eruma-react-wp
Semantic UI and CSS Flex based design designed to display content from WP Rest API.
Late 2017-Summer 2018: Eruma Portfolio
https://github.com/erumaro/eruma-portfolio
Redesigned version, without Semantic UI of Eruma go as a wp plugin with borrowed design from Eruma-Yon theme.
Local version have been tested and worked and looked nice, Live version release not working due errors. Need to fix these issues, but might take a while...
